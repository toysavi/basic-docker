# 1. Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It's a leading containerization technology that allows you to package your applications and all their dependencies into standardized units called containers. These containers are portable and can run consistently on any Linux system.
### What is Docker?
Imagine a shipping container. It's a standardized unit that can transport goods anywhere in the world. Similarly, Docker containers are standardized units that can transport your applications anywhere. They are self-contained and include everything your application needs to run, including the code, libraries, system tools, and runtime environment.

This makes Docker a powerful tool for developers and system administrators. It allows you to:
 
 - <b>Develop and deploy applications faster</b>: With Docker containers, you can easily build, test, and deploy your applications without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues.
 - <b>Run applications consistently</b>: Docker containers run the same way on any Linux system, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This ensures that your applications will run consistently in development, testing, and production.
 - <b>Increase portability and isolation</b>: Docker containers are isolated from the host system, which makes them more portable and secure. This also helps to prevent conflicts between applications.
 - <b>Scale your applications easily</b>: You can easily scale your applications by adding more Docker containers. This makes it easy to handle increased traffic and demand.

 ### Benefits of using Docker:
 - <B>Increased developer productivity</B>: Docker helps developers to focus on writing code instead of worrying about infrastructure. Developers can quickly spin up new environments and test their applications with ease.
- <B>Faster application delivery</B>: Docker containers are lightweight and portable, which allows you to deploy your applications faster. You can also easily roll back changes if necessary.
- <B>Improved application scalability</B>: Docker containers are easy to scale up and down, which makes it easy to handle fluctuations in traffic and demand.
- <B>Reduced infrastructure costs</B>: Docker containers are more efficient than virtual machines, which can help to reduce your infrastructure costs.
- <B>Improved application security</B>: Docker containers are isolated from the host system, which helps to improve the security of your applications.

### Docker terminology:
- <B>Image</B>: An image is a read-only template that contains instructions for creating a container. It includes all of the code, libraries, and system tools that your application needs to run.
- <B>Container</B>: A container is a running instance of an image. It is isolated from the host system and other containers.
- <B>Registry</B>: A registry is a place where you can store and share Docker images. There are public and private registries available.

### Installing Docker:
The process of installing Docker depends on your operating system. Here are the links to the installation instructions for the most popular operating systems:
- <B>Linux</B>: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
- <B>Mac</B>: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
- <B>Windows</B>: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

Once you have Docker installed, you can start using it to build, run, and manage your applications.
